# ACDH-CH Hackathon 2020
The repo containing your task for the ACDH-CH Hackathon 2020. This task is open for submissions from 28 February 2020 (2 pm CET) - 31 March 2020 (midnight CET). 
More information about the hackathon is available on the [ACDH-CH website](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/detail/event/acdh-ch-open-data-virtual-hackathon-round-two/).

## Results!
The [results](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/ACDHchHackathon2020/blob/master/results.md) and winners of the ACDH-CH Hackathon 2020 have been published! 

## Your task
The hack of the ACDH-CH virtual hackathon 2020 focuses on Open Data that is of interest for the [Digital Humanities Course Registry](https://dhcr.clarin-dariah.eu/), a platform that provides an overview of the growing range of available teaching activities in the field of digital humanities worldwide. In this hack, your task is to develop a creative mode of visualizing data and metadata about teaching activities. You can visualize the data themselves or the results of statistical analysis done with the data. You are free to choose your visualisation except for a map based visualisation (because this visualisation is already implemented in the DH Course Registry).  
**Note: No map based visualisations are eligible for this task.**
The dataset to be worked on in this task is the data from the DH Course Registry: Data and Metadata regarding whole BA, MA and PhD programmes or single courses, summer schools and training events for continuous education in the area of Digital Humanities. The data contains information on the topics taught, the course language, the dates etc. For data export, analysis or custom visualisations, a public JSON data API is available [here](https://dhcr.clarin-dariah.eu/api/v1/).


## What your submission should contain

Each submission has to include code, an instruction on how to run it (readme), a short presentation of what was done (in a format of your choice: poster, video, description,...), enriched data (if applicable) and statistics on the data (if applicable).

## Judgement criteria

Your submission will be judged by the following criteria:
* Creativity, innovation  (e.g. Is the approach/idea new and unique? Does it do something that hasn’t been done before? Does it provide new insights into the data? Does the hack provide a new/faster/clearer solution to the old problem?)
* Accessibility, reusability, reproducibility (e.g. Is the code properly documented? Is the technical approach reproducible?)
* Elegance (e.g. Is the code easy to modify and reuse? Is it readable for others? Is modularity considered in the design? Is the code simple and concise?)

## Openness

Participants will work on their solutions in a dedicated (own) GitHub repository. Once you have finished your work, set your repo to public, tag it #ACDHhackathon2020 and send the repo link to vanessa.hannesschlaeger[at]oeaw.ac.at and tanja.wissik[at]oeaw.ac.at.

All code submitted by all participants (as well as all reviews by all judges) shall be made permanently publicly available on GitHub under an MIT license (or similarly permissive license, respectively a fitting open license for submissions of enriched data and presentation material). By submitting their code to this challange, participants agree to these terms.

## Judges

The following coding experts will act as judges for this hackathon:
* Lenka Bajčetić 
* John McCrae 
* Renato Rocha Souza
* Gerlinde Schneider
* Omar Siam
* Marcella Tambuscio
