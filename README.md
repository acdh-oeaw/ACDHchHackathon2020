The repo containing your task for the ACDH-CH Hackathon 2020. This task is open for submissions from 28 February 2020 (2 pm CET) - 31 March 2020 (midnight CET). 
More information about the hackathon is available on the [ACDH-CH website](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/detail/event/acdh-ch-open-data-virtual-hackathon-round-two/).

## Your task
 **to be published on 28 February 2020 (2 pm CET)**


## What your submission should contain

Each submission has to include code, an instruction on how to run it (readme), a short presentation of what was done (in a format of your choice: poster, video, description,...), enriched data (if applicable) and statistics on the data (if applicable).

## Judgement criteria

Your submission will be judged by the following criteria:
* Creativity, innovation  (e.g. Is the approach/idea new and unique? Does it do something that hasnâ€™t been done before? Does it provide new insights into the data? Does the hack provide a new/faster/clearer solution to the old problem?)
* Accessibility, reusability, reproducibility (e.g. Is the code properly documented? Is the technical approach reproducible?)
* Elegance (e.g. Is the code easy to modify and reuse? Is it readable for others? Is modularity considered in the design? Is the code simple and concise?)

## Openness

Participants will work on their solutions in a dedicated (own) GitHub repository. Once you have finished your work, set your repo to public, tag it #ACDHhackathon2020 and send the repo link to vanessa.hannesschlaeger[at]oeaw.ac.at and tanja.wissik[at]oeaw.ac.at.

All code submitted by all participants (as well as all reviews by all judges) shall be made permanently publicly available on GitHub under an MIT license (or similarly permissive license, respectively a fitting open license for submissions of enriched data and presentation material). By submitting their code to this challange, participants agree to these terms.

## Judges

The following coding experts will act as judges for this hackathon:
